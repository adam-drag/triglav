# Triglav

A local coordination service for AI agents that work like a small software consultancy on Linear tickets. A Staff agent plans and delegates, Senior agents implement, researchers advise on a shared message board, and the Client (a human) watches and steps in from a dashboard.

You start Staff agents in your own CLI (Claude Code). Staff starts Seniors with its CLI's own tools. Researchers have no running session: Triglav starts a short Codex run (or a Claude Code run when Codex is not installed) when one has work. Every agent talks to the orchestrator over MCP. The orchestrator itself runs in Docker and cannot start processes, so a small host runner (`scripts/runner.ts`) starts the runs and resumes you ask for in the dashboard.

AI coding agents working on this repository: read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (Claude Code loads it through CLAUDE.md). Design and rationale: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Requirements: [PROJECT-BRIEF.md](PROJECT-BRIEF.md) and [ROLES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md](ROLES-AND-WORKFLOWS.md). Agent instructions: one card per role in [src/guide/](src/guide/), served at `/guide.md?role=<staff|senior|reviewer|researcher>` and by the `get_guide` tool. `/guide.md` without a role is the whole guide, including the CLI setup.

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # fill in the values; openssl rand -hex 24 for each secret
docker compose up -d --build
node scripts/runner.ts      # on the host, in its own terminal (or under nohup); see "Host runner"
# then open http://localhost:7400 for the dashboard
```

The service listens on `127.0.0.1:7400` only. MySQL data lives in the `mysql-data` volume. `docker compose down` keeps it; `docker compose down -v` deletes it. The image builds the dashboard itself, so `docker compose up -d --build` is also how you deploy a change.

Without `LINEAR_API_KEY`, the Staff agent reads the ticket through Linear MCP and passes it as `ticket_snapshot`. With a read-only key, the orchestrator fetches the ticket and its sub-issues itself and refreshes them every 5 minutes.

## Host runner

`node scripts/runner.ts` polls Triglav every 5 seconds for launches and starts them on this machine. It reads `ORCH_ENROLLMENT_KEY` from `.env`. Every five minutes it also checks which of `claude` and `codex` are installed and tells Triglav; the Models page and the New job form show it, with the models each CLI lists (`codex debug models`, and Claude Code's own reply to its initialize request), so models are chosen from lists and never typed. When only one is installed, roles saved for the other use it instead (Opus 5.5 high for researchers on Claude Code, `gpt-6.1-sol` on Codex), without changing the saved settings. It never runs a command string from the server: it builds each command itself after checking every field. For a new job it receives only the request id, the directory, the model and the effort; the Client's URL and prompt text never reach a command line.

| Launch | Started from | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resume a stopped Staff | Client decisions page, Resume | `claude --bg --settings '{"autoCompactWindow":300000}' --resume <session> <prompt>` |
| Start Staff on a new job | New job page | `claude --bg -n staff-<request> --settings '{"autoCompactWindow":300000}' --model <staff model> --effort <staff effort> 'Call get_guide with role staff and follow it. Start job request <request>.'` |
| Researcher run | Triglav, when a persona's inbox has work | `codex exec -s read-only ...` |
| Operator chat | Operator page | `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --permission-mode dontAsk --allowedTools <read-only tools> --strict-mcp-config` |

Logs go to `~/.local/state/triglav/`.

**Operator.** The Operator page is a chat with Claude Code on this machine, for how-to questions and for finding out why an agent or job is stuck. The runner keeps one `claude` process per chat, in this repository, and streams its reply to the dashboard. The process can read, but not change, anything: `--permission-mode dontAsk` with an allow-list (file reads, `claude agents`, `claude logs`, `docker compose ps` and `logs`, `git status` and `log`) denies everything else, and its only MCP server is Triglav's `/operator/mcp`, with a token that belongs to that chat. It changes things only by asking. Its `propose_*` tools (pause, resume or cancel a job, poke an agent, resume a stopped Staff, start a job, approve a job, answer a decision, reassign Staff, set a role's model, stop a Claude background session) put a card in the chat. The card text is written from Triglav's data, nothing happens until the Client clicks Confirm, and a confirmed action does what the matching dashboard button does. Stopping a Claude session runs on the host: the runner checks the id and runs `claude stop`. An unanswered card expires after 30 minutes. The model is `ORCH_OPERATOR_MODEL` (default `claude-sonnet-5-5`) and the effort `ORCH_OPERATOR_EFFORT` (default `medium`) in the runner's environment. After 20 idle minutes the process ends; the next message resumes the same conversation. `ORCH_CLAUDE_BIN` replaces the `claude` binary and `ORCH_RUNNER_CHAT_ONLY=1` makes the runner serve only the Operator: both are for tests. Without the runner, Resume stays queued and researcher runs never start.

## Connect agents

`<key>` is `ORCH_ENROLLMENT_KEY` from `.env`.

Claude Code (all projects). The 3500 second timeout lets Staff wait 50 minutes on its one-hour prompt cache (verified 2026-10-09):

```bash
claude mcp add-json --scope user orchestrator '{"type":"http","url":"http://localhost:7400/mcp","timeout":3500000,"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer <key>"}}'
```

Add `"mcp__orchestrator__*"` to `permissions.allow` in `~/.claude/settings.json` so unattended agents do not stop at prompts. Add `scripts/stop-hook.sh` as a `Stop` hook there too: it keeps Staff and Seniors from ending their turn while they own open work. Seniors also need their git and test commands allowed in the target repository's `.claude/settings.local.json`. The guide's CLI setup section (`/guide.md`) has the details.

Codex, for researcher runs, in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.orchestrator]
url = "http://localhost:7400/mcp"
http_headers = { Authorization = "Bearer <key>" }
tool_timeout_sec = 330
default_tools_approval_mode = "auto"
```

**Plan limits on the Usage page.** Codex writes its 5-hour and weekly usage into every transcript, so Triglav shows it on its own. Claude writes only the reset time of a refused request. For Claude percentages, use `scripts/claude-statusline.sh` as your Claude Code status line (`"statusLine": {"type": "command", "command": "/path/to/triglav/scripts/claude-statusline.sh"}` in `~/.claude/settings.json`): Claude Code passes it `rate_limits`, and the script forwards them to Triglav in the background.

Use a Codex CLI recent enough for the researcher model. The Arch package `openai-codex` 0.153.4 refuses `gpt-6.1-sol`; the npm package `@openai/codex` 0.162.0 accepts it (`npm i -g @openai/codex`, and check that `which codex` finds it first).

## Start work

- **New job from the dashboard (needs the host runner):** open Jobs, then New job. Choose a mode, give the repository path and the base branch (default `main`), and submit. The server checks every field (URL http or https without credentials, absolute path, git-safe branch, length caps) and shows errors next to the form. It stores a job request and queues a `staff_start` launch; the runner checks that the directory exists inside your home directory and starts Staff with the runtime, model and effort from the Models page (`claude --bg`, or a detached `codex exec` when Staff is set to Codex). Staff reads the request with `get_job_request`. The form follows the request until Staff has registered the job: it spins while queued and started, shows the reason when the start fails (the runner turns known failures such as an untrusted folder or a missing command into one plain sentence), and a failed or never-registered start stays visible as a bar on every page until the Client retries or dismisses it (`POST /api/job-requests/:id/retry` and `/dismiss`).
  - **Link:** any ticket URL (Linear, Jira, a GitHub issue). Staff reads it with whatever MCP it has and registers the snapshot. Only Linear jobs are refreshed from Linear; the other jobs keep the snapshot Staff read.
  - **Prompt:** a free text. The job starts in status `refining`. Staff writes the goal, scope and non-goals (the job's plan) and the acceptance criteria, and asks its open questions on the job's General thread. On the job page you answer, edit the proposal, or both; each answer or edit wakes Staff, who revises. Approve moves the job to `planning` and wakes Staff. Only the Approve button moves a job out of `refining`; Staff cannot.
- **Staff by hand:** the Models page has a ready launch command per ticket, with the model, effort and compaction setting. It starts Claude Code in the background with a prompt like `Call get_guide with role staff and follow it. Work on Linear ticket ENG-123 in repository /path/to/repo, base branch main.` Staff then registers the job, plans it, and starts Seniors with `create_spawn_ticket` and its CLI's subagents.
- **Researchers:** add a persona on the Researchers page (name, focus, repository, model, effort). It has no process. Triglav routes questions, proposals, mentions, review rounds and Client decisions into its inbox and starts a short run when items are ready, holding back when the Codex usage window is nearly used up.
- **After a reboot or a usage limit:** the Client decisions page lists stopped Staff with a Resume button. Staff then restarts its Seniors.

## Test

Three layers. None of them touches the real stack's data.

```bash
pnpm typecheck

# Unit, protocol and coordination tests (vitest, capped at 4 workers). They need a throwaway MySQL.
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --wait
ORCH_TEST_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:test@127.0.0.1:33061/mysql pnpm test

# Browser end-to-end tests (Playwright) against a throwaway stack on :7401.
pnpm e2e:up
pnpm e2e            # report in e2e-report/, failure screenshots and traces in e2e-results/
pnpm e2e:down
```

The browser tests drive the dashboard while scripted agents use the real MCP tools. They fail on any browser console error. Without `pnpm e2e:up` they stop at once with an instruction instead of starting anything.

`scripts/live-check.ts` checks real researcher CLIs against the :7401 stack. It was written for the old researcher wait loop and has not been updated for persona runs.

## Develop

Node 24 runs the TypeScript sources directly (type stripping), so the server has no build step.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:web               # dashboard into web/dist
DATABASE_URL=... ORCH_ENROLLMENT_KEY=... pnpm dev
```

Schema changes are numbered SQL files in `src/migrations/`, applied in order at start.
